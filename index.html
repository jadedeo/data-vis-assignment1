          Subtheme: The Dynamics of Drug Overdose Trends in Response to Societal
          Shifts
        </h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <p>
          I'm curious as to how outside forces, particularly global events,
          trigger changes in overdose trends.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before targeting those changes, I need to know who they're
            affecting. Coming from an exceedingly diverse city (NYC), I've
            always heard that substances disproportionately affect marginalized
            communities. What trends exist between various demographic
            characteristics and fatal overdoses? Who is most affected by
            substance overdoses? Where are these incidents happening?
          </li>
          <li>
            The drug epidemic and particularly
            <a href="https://www.dea.gov/fentanylawareness"
              >the fentanyl crisis</a
            >
            have been in the news for years. Will this data reflect that? How
            have the patterns of substance use in overdose deaths changed over
            time?
          </li>
          <li>
            What does this data look like as a function of time? Specifically,
            did COVID-19 have an effect on overdose rates?
            <a
              href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide"
              >An increase in cases of depression, anxiety, and other mental
              health-related illnesses was noted under the stressful
              circumstances of the pandemic.</a
            >
            I wonder if this trend would follow for alcohol and drug use.

        <h2>Initial Overview</h2>
        <h3>The Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          This dataset contains 7,000+ entries pertaining to substance overdose
          deaths in Allegheny county. This includes: death date and time,
          decedent's age, sex, race, the zip code in which the body was received
          (Incident Zip), and the substances associated with the overdose
          (Combined Od1 to 10).
        </p>

        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset includes many entries with zip codes that were clearly not
          in Pennsylvania, and many others still that are not in Allegheny
          county. Despite some refinement, those in the map are still not solely
          confined to the county. There were also a small number of records with
          the race of the decedent listed as “None” that needed to be filtered
          out; I wonder why these records were not classified under
          "U"/"Unknown".
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps not an issue of quality, but I noticed that the data for 2024
          seems drastically different and acknowledge that the year is not yet
          complete (see Figure 3 and Figure 7). I wonder if this marked decrease
          is accurate and there truly have been such significant strides in
          reducing fatal substance overdoses, or whether this lends to that
          incompleteness.

            Top 10 Substances Most Commonly Associated with Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As a means of providing an preliminary glance into the data, this
              bar chart illustrates the top 10 substances most commonly
              associated with fatal accidental overdose in Allegheny County. In
              reference to Q2, we see that Fentanyl does indeed appear as the
              leading substance followed by Cocaine and Heroin. The data
              provides a clear comparison of the frequency at which these
              substances are found in overdose cases, serving as a crucial
              insight for public health interventions focused on these high-risk
              drugs.

            Fatal Overdose Hotspots
            <p>
              This map highlights overdose hotspots within Allegheny County, PA,
              and some surrounding areas, with darker shades indicating regions
              with higher numbers of fatal overdoses. The visualization provides
              a broad overview of the geographic aspect of the dataset while
              also effectively pinpointing areas most affected by drug
              overdoses. We can see that these hotspots are especially
              concentrated around the city of Pittsburgh and/or in less rural
              areas, which would be expected simply due to population. Despite
              minor data cleanliness issues, this focused approach provides a
              clear view of critical areas. This map, combined with the bar
              chart in Figure 1, gives rise to a new question: Do certain
              substances appear more heavily in a select zip codes?
            </p>
          </figcaption>

            Top 10 Substances in Accidental Overdoses by Zip Code
            <p>
              To answer the question above, this heatmap effectively showcases
              how different substances impact various zip codes. Darker shades
              indicate higher numbers of incidents, pinpointing critical areas
              for potential intervention. Fentanyl and Heroin prominently
              feature across numerous zip codes, reflecting their significant
              contribution to overdose statistics in the region. A visualization
              of this sort could aid in identifying hotspots where public health
              resources and preventive measures could be most urgently deployed
              more precisely than Figure 2. Though the information is no longer
              available, it would have been interesting to see how the
              decedents' zip codes align to this data. How much would incident
              zip and decedent zip vary? And, though the necessarily information
              is not available in this dataset, would the demographics of these
              hotspots match up to what we will find for the most at-risk
              groups?

          <figcaption>
            Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              Also essential for understanding the big picture provided by the
              dataset, this line graph shows the trend of fatal overdoses over
              time. It highlights a significant peak around 2018 before a
              notable decline; the recent sharp decrease suggests either an
              effective intervention or a change in data reporting or
              collection. This visualization serves as a critical tool for
              analyzing the impacts of health policies and the potential
              emergence of new trends in substance use over time. To connect
              back to Q3, we do see an increase in overdoses during the years of
              the pandemic, and then a decrease as it's brought under control.
              However, this increase seems to have begun in 2018. If we consider
              2020 to be the year in which COVID was first felt in the U.S., I'm
              not sure this increase can be attributed to the pandemic; I think
              that would require revisting with additional research outside of
              this dataset. However, following this general overview, we can now
              look into the role demographics play in the data (Q1).

            Age Distribution of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As one component of Q1, this histogram displays the age
              distribution of fatal accidental overdoses, showing a pronounced
              peak in the 25 to 55 age range. The graph highlights that
              middle-aged individuals are disproportionately affected by
              overdose deaths. The assumption is that this can likely be
              attributed to exposure and access to disposable income.

            Gender and Race Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As another component of Q1, this bar chart illustrates the
              distribution of fatal accidental overdoses by gender across
              different racial groups, revealing significant disparities in how
              overdose impacts these demographics. Notably, there is a
              pronounced prevalence of overdoses among white males, which is
              substantially higher than in other groups. Given my own context, I
              will admit to being quite surprised to see that white males were
              so heavily affected; it would require outside data, but I wonder
              if this is due to the demographics of the county/state, or if it's
              a rate that applies regardless of population size. This
              visualization underscores the necessity for targeted public health
              interventions that consider the intersection of race and gender in
              addressing the overdose crisis. Figure 4 showed us that certain
              age groups are more susceptible than others, but does this differ
              for males and females?

            Age and Gender Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              In an attempt to answer the question from Figure 5, this graph
              displays trends in fatal overdoses across different age groups for
              males and females. It shows a noticeable peak in overdoses among
              mid-aged individuals, with males experiencing a higher peak around
              age 45-50 and females peaking slightly earlier. The data indicates
              that overdoses decline significantly after age 60. Together with
              Figure 5, we're able to put together a suggestion of a profile for
              the most vulnerable population: while males of around 45-50 years
              old.

          <figcaption>
            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              In response to Q2, this line graph displays the trends in the
              number of fatal overdoses associated with various substances from
              2007 to 2024. Each line represents a different substance,
              highlighting significant shifts in usage patterns over time (the
              Combined Od columns were pivoted to achieve this). Notably, the
              sharp rise and subsequent decline of Fentanyl usage and the
              relatively stable trend in substances like Methadone and Morphine
              could provide insights into changing drug usage dynamics, possibly
              influenced by factors like policy changes, market availability, or
              public health interventions. This visualization is crucial for
              understanding how different substances have influenced overdose
              rates over the years. Two further questions arise: What does the
              prevalence of these substances look like relative to age? And to
              race?

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Age
            <p>
              In response to the question posed under Figure 6, this scatter
              plot illustrates the correlation between age and the types of
              substances involved in fatal overdoses. Each colored dot
              represents a different substance, showing how certain drugs are
              more prevalent in specific age groups. Notably, Fentanyl and
              Heroin appear frequently in middle-aged individuals - Heroin usage
              seems to peak in adults 25-35 years old, while Fentanyl use peaks
              in those 25-40 - while substances like Alprazolam and Methadone
              are more evenly distributed across age ranges. Though it can't be
              determined from this dataset, I wonder why this is. Is it a matter
              of access or lifestyle?

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Race
            <p>
              This grouped bar chart reveals the differences in substances
              associated with fatal overdoses among the dataset's 3 more
              represented racial groups, also as a follow-up to Figure 6. The
              substances, color-coded for clarity, show pronounced variations;
              for example, Fentanyl and Cocaine are predominant among the white
              population, while Cocaine outranks Fentalnyl for those identified
              as Black. With Fentanyl having such a strong lead in essentially
              every other regard within the dataset, this is interesting. The
              impact of other substances like Methadone and Heroin varies
              notably across races.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain communities are considered especially vulnerable to
              substance abuse due to both historical and present day
              circumstances. Indigenous people, for example, appear as such a
              small fraction of this dataset that they are excluded here, but in
              terms of proportion experience the highest rates of drug-related
              death in the country. Though it's not a question that can be
              answered with this dataset alone and would require at least the
              broader demographics of Allegheny county, I would be curious to
              see if these statistics hold true.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          This analysis has delved into the intricate dynamics of drug overdose
          trends within Allegheny County, serving as an initial look at how
          societal shifts have influenced patterns of substance overdoses. The
          exploration revealed significant demographic disparities in overdose
          occurrences, with infamous substances like Fentanyl markedly affecting
          various age groups and races. As mentioned in the captions, there are
          a few instances they could be further improved if joined with general
          census/demographic data, or additional information about the decedent.
          Evem so, the visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the
          overdose landscape, from geographical hotspots to temporal trends,
          highlighting critical areas for intervention. The insights derived
          could serve to emphasize the necessity for targeted public health
          strategies that consider both the sociodemographic and spatial factors
          contributing to the drug epidemic. Understanding these trends is
          crucial for crafting effective policies and preventive measures to
          combat the ongoing crisis in drug-related fatalities.
