          <li>
            What does this data look like as a function of time? Specifically,
            did COVID-19 have an effect on overdose rates?

            have been in the news for years. Will this data reflect that? How

            time?

        <h2>Initial Overview</h2>
        <h3>The Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          This dataset contains 7,000+ entries pertaining to substance overdose
          deaths in Allegheny county. This includes: death date and time,
          decedent's age, sex, race, the zip code in which the body was received
          (Incident Zip), and the substances associated with the overdose
          (Combined Od1 to 10).
        </p>

        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset includes many entries with zip codes that were clearly not
          in Pennsylvania, and many others still that are not in Allegheny
          county. Despite some refinement, those in the map are still not solely
          confined to the county. There were also a small number of records with
          the race of the decedent listed as “None” that needed to be filtered
          out; I wonder why these records were no classified under
          "U"/"Unknown".
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps not an issue of quality, but I noticed that the data for 2024
          seems drastically different and acknowledge that the year is not year
          complete (see Figure 3 and Figure 7). I wonder if this marked decrease
          is accurate and there truly have been such significant strides in
          reducing fatal substance overdoses, or whether this lends to that
          incompleteness.

            Top 10 Substances Most Commonly Associated with Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As a means of providing an preliminary glance into the data, this
              bar chart illustrates the top 10 substances most commonly
              associated with fatal accidental overdose in Allegheny County. In
              reference to Q2, we see that Fentanyl does indeed appear as the
              leading substance followed by Cocaine and Heroin. The data
              provides a clear comparison of the frequency at which these
              substances are found in overdose cases, serving as a crucial
              insight for public health interventions focused on these high-risk
              drugs.

            Fatal Overdose Hotspots
            <p>
              This map highlights overdose hotspots within Allegheny County, PA,
              and some surrounding areas, with darker shades indicating regions
              with higher numbers of fatal overdoses. The visualization provides
              a broad overview of the geographic aspect of the dataset while
              also effectively pinpointing areas most affected by drug
              overdoses. We can see that these hotspots are especially
              concentrated around the city of Pittsburgh and/or in less rural
              areas, which would be expected simply due to population. Despite
              minor data cleanliness issues, this focused approach provides a
              clear view of critical areas. This map combined with the bar chart
              in Figure 1 give rise to a new question: Do certain substances
              appear more heavily in a select zip codes?

            Top 10 Substances in Accidental Overdoses by Zip Code
            <p>
              To answer the question above, this heatmap effectively showcases
              how different substances impact various zip codes. Darker shades
              indicate higher numbers of incidents, pinpointing critical areas
              for potential intervention. Fentanyl and Heroin prominently
              feature across numerous zip codes, reflecting their significant
              contribution to overdose statistics in the region. A visualization
              of this sort could aid in identifying hotspots where public health
              resources and preventive measures could be most urgently deployed
              more precisely than Figure 2. Overall, this map serves as a
              crucial tool for understanding spatial trends in overdose
              occurrences and tailoring public health responses accordingly.

            Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              Also essential for understanding the big picture provided by the
              dataset, this line graph shows the trend of fatal overdoses over
              time. It highlights a significant peak around 2018 before a
              notable decline; the recent sharp decrease suggests either an
              effective intervention or a change in data reporting or
              collection. This visualization serves as a critical tool for
              analyzing the impacts of health policies and the potential
              emergence of new trends in substance use over time. To connect
              back to Q1, we do see an increase in overdoses during the years of
              the pandemic, and then a decrease as it's brought under control.
              However, this increase seems to have begun in 2018 - I'm not sure
              that it can be attributed to COVID-19. Following this general
              overview, we can now look into the role demographics play in the
              data (Q3).

            Age Distribution of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As one component of Q3, this histogram displays the age
              distribution of fatal accidental overdoses, showing a pronounced
              peak in the 25 to 55 age range. The graph highlights that
              middle-aged individuals are disproportionately affected by
              overdose deaths. The assumption is that this can likely be
              attributed to exposure and access to disposable income.

            Gender and Race Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              As another component of Q3, this bar chart illustrates the
              distribution of fatal accidental overdoses by gender across
              different racial groups, revealing significant disparities in how
              overdose impacts these demographics. Notably, there is a
              pronounced prevalence of overdoses among white males, which is
              substantially higher than in other groups. This visualization
              underscores the necessity for targeted public health interventions
              that consider the intersection of race and gender in addressing
              the overdose crisis. Figure 4 showed us that certain age groups
              are more susceptible than others, but does this differ for males
              and females?

            Age and Gender Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              In an attempt to answer the question from Figure 5, this graph
              displays trends in fatal overdoses across different age groups for
              males and females. It shows a noticeable peak in overdoses among
              mid-aged individuals, with males experiencing a higher peak around
              age 45-50 and females peaking slightly earlier. The data indicates
              that overdoses decline significantly after age 60. Together with
              Figure 5, we're able to put together a suggestion of a profile for
              the most vulnerable population: while males of around 45-50 years
              old.

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              In response to Q2, this line graph displays the trends in the
              number of fatal overdoses associated with various substances from
              2007 to 2024. Each line represents a different substance,
              highlighting significant shifts in usage patterns over time (the
              Combined Od columns were pivoted to achieve this). Notably, the
              sharp rise and subsequent decline of Fentanyl usage and the
              relatively stable trend in substances like Methadone and Morphine
              provide insights into changing drug usage dynamics, possibly
              influenced by factors like policy changes, market availability, or
              public health interventions. This visualization is crucial for
              understanding how different substances have influenced overdose
              rates over the years. Two further questions: What does the
              prevalence of these substances look like relative to age? And to
              race?

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Age
            <p>
              In response to the question posed under Figure 6, this scatter
              plot illustrates the correlation between age and the types of
              substances involved in fatal overdoses. Each colored dot
              represents a different substance, showing how certain drugs are
              more prevalent in specific age groups. Notably, Fentanyl and
              Heroin appear frequently in middle-aged individuals - Heroin usage
              seems to peak in adults 25-35 years old, while Fentanyl use peaks
              in those 25-40 - while substances like Alprazolam and Methadone
              are more evenly distributed across age ranges. Though it can't be
              determined from this dataset, I wonder why this is. Is it a matter
              of access or lifestyle?

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Race
            <p>
              This grouped bar chart reveals the differences in substances
              associated with fatal overdoses among the dataset's 3 more
              represented racial groups, also as a follow-up to Figure 6. The
              substances, color-coded for clarity, show pronounced variations;
              for example, Fentanyl and Cocaine are predominant among the white
              population, while Cocaine outranks Fentalnyl for those identified
              as Black. With Fentanyl having such a strong lead in essentially
              every other regard within the dataset, this is interesting. The
              impact of other substances like Methadone and Heroin varies
              notably across races.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain communities are considered especially vulnerable to
              substance abuse due to both historical and present day
              circumstances. Indigenous people, for example, appear as such a
              small fraction of this dataset that they are excluded here, but in
              terms of proportion experience the highest rates of drug-related
              death in the country. Though it's not a question that can be
              answered with this dataset alone and would require at least the
              broader demographics of Allegheny county, I would be curious to
              see if these statistics hold true.
